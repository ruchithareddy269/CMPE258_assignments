## Assignment-2

### Description
The task assigned to us in this assignment is to replicate a set of experiments that were carried out using both closed- and open-source Language Model Models (LLMs), as detailed in the references section.

The main goal is to duplicate the experiments and adapt them to carry out different tasks. You will use various datasets available at Hugging Face in place of the supplied SQL dataset to show your flexibility and inventiveness.

### What to do?
Try the experiments shown in the attached YouTube videos, making sure to include prompt-based generation, fine-tuning, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), local interpreter, function calls, and CPU inference for llama.cpp.

Make inventive changes to the Colab notebooks from the YouTube videos to showcase cutting-edge LLM use cases and applications.

Make the necessary modifications to the Colab notebooks if needed to guarantee proper operation. Make thorough notes about these changes.

Note that the condensed versions of the YouTube videos, which are accessible at Summarize.tech, are a must-watch since they offer a synopsis of the material and function as a springboard for your experiments.

Your assignment should demonstrate your ability to successfully record and present your work, as well as your ability to duplicate and creatively expand upon the experiments. If you have any questions or need any small adjustments made to the Colab notebooks, don't hesitate to contact us.

## Assignment-4


Perform the following tasks:

Write an agent from scratch using tools in python. Be sure to use the class slides code as inspiration. There are also other good examples of creating agents from scratch.
Demonstrate various agent use cases using langchain.
Be sure to write a README.md file and create a proper GitHub directory structure for your assignment. Include a Demo Video.

# Assignment-5

##  Guidelines

It is important to note that you will need to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. You must create a 3-layer neural network.You must use einsum.
2. Use a non-linear 3-dimensional equation.
4. Generate syntetic data using the equation you used and plot using 4-d plot in matplotlib.

After completing the colabs, you will need to upload a video showing the code checked into GitHub as well as a code walkthrough of the main sections and any final output that is generated.

## Assignment Description

Complete the following parts

1. Numpy
2. PyTorch without built-in layer functionality
3. **PyTorch WITH built-in functionality**
