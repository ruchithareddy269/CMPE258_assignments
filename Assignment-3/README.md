## Assignment-3
### Description:
### Perform the following tasks:

a) Use FastAI to write a detailed Colab notebook (without copying from hints) that shows training and inference for the following tasks using FastAI. Showcase results and metrics:

Vision object detection task
Vision segmentation task
Tabular task
Recommendation task


b) Use Hugging Face Transformers API for various tasks:

Text classification
Named entity recognition
Question answering
Text summarization
Translation
Zero-shot classification
Computer vision
Audio
Table QA


c) Use Keras-NLP for various NLP tasks:

Inference with a pretrained classifier
Fine-tuning a pretrained backbone
Fine-tuning with user-controlled preprocessing
Fine-tuning a custom model


d) Use Keras-CV for various vision tasks:

Object detection using the YOLO model
Inference with a pretrained classifier
Fine-tuning a pretrained backbone
Training an image classifier from scratch
Training a custom object detection model
Be sure to write a README.md file and create a proper GitHub directory structure for your assignment.
