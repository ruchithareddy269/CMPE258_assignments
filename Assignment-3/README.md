## Assignment-3
### Description:

### PART-1: 
Use FastAI to write a detailed Colab notebook (without copying from hints) that shows training and inference for the following tasks using FastAI. Showcase results and metrics:

#### Vision Object Detection Task:
In this task, you will use FastAI to train a model for object detection, where the goal is to detect and localize objects within an image.
#### Vision Segmentation Task:
Here, you'll utilize FastAI for image segmentation, where the objective is to partition an image into multiple segments or regions based on semantic meaning.
#### Tabular Task: 
This involves using FastAI for tabular data analysis, where you'll train a model to predict a target variable based on input features in a structured tabular dataset.
#### Recommendation Task: 
In this task, you'll explore how FastAI can be used for recommendation systems, where the goal is to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their past interactions or preferences.


### PART-2: 
Use Hugging Face Transformers API for various tasks:


#### Text Classification: 
You'll employ the Hugging Face Transformers API to train a model for text classification, where the model predicts the category or class of a given text.
#### Named Entity Recognition (NER): 
Here, you'll use Transformers for NER, where the model identifies and classifies entities (such as names, organizations, and locations) within text.
#### Question Answering: 
This task involves training a model to answer questions posed in natural language based on a given context passage.
#### Text Summarization: 
You'll explore how to use Transformers for text summarization, where the model generates a concise summary of a longer text.
#### Translation: 
In this task, you'll utilize Transformers for machine translation, where the model translates text from one language to another.
#### Zero-Shot Classification:
Here, you'll demonstrate zero-shot classification using Transformers, where the model predicts the class of a given input text even if it hasn't been explicitly trained on that class.
#### Computer vision
#### Audio
#### Table QA




### PART-3:  
Use Keras-NLP for various NLP tasks:

#### Inference with a Pretrained Classifier:  
You'll use Keras-NLP to perform inference with a pretrained classifier, making predictions on new text data.
#### Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Backbone: 
This involves fine-tuning a pretrained NLP model on a specific task or dataset to improve performance.
#### Fine-Tuning with User-Controlled Preprocessing:  
Here, you'll fine-tune a pretrained model while controlling the preprocessing steps applied to the input data.
#### Fine-Tuning a Custom Model: 
This task involves fine-tuning a custom-built NLP model using Keras-NLP, allowing for more flexibility and customization.


### PART-4: 
Use Keras-CV for various vision tasks:

#### Object Detection Using YOLO Model:  
You'll train a YOLO model for object detection tasks using Keras-CV, which is a popular deep learning model for real-time object detection.
#### Inference with a Pretrained Classifier:
This involves performing inference with a pretrained vision classifier, making predictions on new images.
#### Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Backbone:  
Here, you'll fine-tune a pretrained vision model on a specific task or dataset to improve performance.
#### Training an Image Classifier from Scratch: 
This task involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) image classifier from scratch, starting with random weights.
#### Training a Custom Object Detection Model: 
Finally, you'll train a custom object detection model using Keras-CV, allowing for customization based on specific requirements or use cases.
